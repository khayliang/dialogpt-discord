# dialogpt-discord
A discord chat bot implementation with DialoGPT as a conversational model.

# Installation
Before you do anything here, follow the guide [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html) to setup a bot account and invite the bot account into your server. Copy your bot authentication token. 

Installation is done with conda. Go download it if you don't have it.

Download the repository. Run `conda env create -f environment.yml`inside it, then run `conda activate gpt2-discord`

Go to `config.yaml` and paste your token where it tells you to.

Once all that is done, run `python bot_script.py`

# Usage
To talk to your bot, send `$imlonely` in the chat. The bot will respond. You can proceed to chat normally to unlonely yourself.
